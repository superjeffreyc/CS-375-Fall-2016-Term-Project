<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> last people you'd expect to be in-volved in anything strange or mysterious, because <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y just didn't hold with such nonsense.Mr. Dursley was <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, al-though he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> neighbors. Thee Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>ir opinion <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>re was no finer boy anywhere.The Dursleys had everything <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y wanted, but <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y also had a secret, and <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>ir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y could bear it if anyone found out about <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> neighbors would say if <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> Potters arrived in <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> street. The Dursleys knew that <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> Potters had a small son, too, but <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y had never even seen him. He is boy was ano<span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>r good reason for keeping <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> Potters away; <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>y didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>re was nothing about <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happen-ing all over <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.None of <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span>m noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> window.At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> walls. Little tyke, chortled Mr. Dursley as he left <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> house. He got into his car and backed out of number fours drive.It was on <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> corner of <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> street that he noticed <span style = "background-color: #FFFF00">the</span> first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map. </body></html>
