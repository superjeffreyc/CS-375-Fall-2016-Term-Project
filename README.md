String Searching Algorithms
By Jeffrey Chan and Anson Varughese

## Algorithms
 BruteForce Algorithm
- explanation complexity, preprocessing etc..

Rabin Karp Algorithm
- (explanation)

Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm
- (explanation)

## Things to Finish
- split main file into multiple functions with testing and timing seperated
- integrate RK in testing
- create more test cases
- have html file show time for each algo as well
- litter code with more comments? (probably not needed though)
- change highlighting color and/or method
- change up html doc to make it better presentation?

## How To Run
```sh
	$ make
	$ ./SearchComparisons
	$ cd ../test/
	$ firefox t3Output.html &
```
Change up the test files to see different ones in html with highlight
